# Python_api_homework
# WeatherPy

I was tasked with creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I had to utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

# My objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:


Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


# My final notebook must:


Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.


# As final considerations:


I had to complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
I had to use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
I had to include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
I had to use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.


The city data is generated based on random coordinates; as such, your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.
